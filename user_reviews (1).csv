0,"Ummmmm, where do I begin. I didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews. I saw the poster and title and thought, ""I'm definitely watching that."" After seeing it, I can say with confidence that it's exactly what a movie named Cocaine Bear should be.Aside from being an extremely fun and outrageous thriller, this movie is hysterical. I was full-volume laughing frequently. So many parts are the perfect combination of memorable and hilarious. It knows exactly what it's doing.The other thing that made me happy is seeing a studio have the courage to allow the filmmakers to go all out. I compare it to M3gan which was going for a similar tone. But M3gan was toned down to PG-13 so teens could watch. Cocaine Bear is rated R as it absolutely should be. It's not gratuitous but it never feels like it's holding back.I had a blast with this movie. If the title or premise intrigue you, you will most likely be pleased.

1,"This film is exactly what you think it is. It's a bear on cocaine going crazy in the woods. That doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually surprisingly good.It's such a good thriller. You're on the edge of your seat for most of it and when you're not on the edge of your seat, you're laughing your ass off.The cast is actually very unrelated. Keri Russell is phenomenal. Alden Ehrenreich And O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son) are great together and have great chemistry.The production value is so so it is definitely not a super high budget film. But it doesn't look bad. The editing as well done especially during the action scenes and the CGI is actually pretty good."
2,"What a wild ride! The ""ambulance scene"" alone makes this movie worth a watch. Totally insane, scary, funny and gory. The bear is really well made and most of the scenes with it are bananas. A lot of different characters throughout the movie. They all have their own sub plot but they blend pretty well. When it tends to drag a little bit the bear always pops out for more fun and kills so it's always entertaining and goofy. Great directing, special effects and acting. Most of the easy jokes landed, the whole theatre was laughing out loud the entire movie. A good comedy horror entry. Nothing revolutionary but ultimately a really fun popcorn movie."
3,"Cocaine Bear is the story of a bear who takes too much cocaine and does stuff like dance, wiggle, and kill, kill, kill. It has about 12 characters we never delve too deep into but somehow they all end up involved with the bear and there is a lot of death, comedy, and bizarre scenes. The film is incredibly strange as it is not exactly funny, heartwarming, or scary...yet is delves into all three of these and sort of keeps you smiling and kind of bizarrely focused and enjoying yourself. Also, a classic final film for the legendary Ray Liotta - and TBH it's wroth seeing just to see the legendary Ray in his final role."
4,"I first groaned and rolled my eyes when I heard they made a film about a bear on cocaine, named Cocaine Bear. I Googled the name to look for the trailer, and stumbled on the Wikipedia page where I learned this movie is loosely based on actual events, and that's what sold me to give it a watch. If the fact a bear actually found and did cocaine for months isn't funny enough alone to give this film a watch, I don't know what is.I'm just glad the filmmakers and producers took the already hilarious true concept, and made a film just as ridiculously funny. It's been a while I've heard an entire theatre burst out in laughter so many times. The entire film was simply put, comedy gold. The story could've been a little tighter in a few of the subplots, but the casting of the various colorful characters and all their performances made up for any of the writing issues.The 95 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing, and the soundtrack was awesome and spot-on for that era. This truly is one of those rare ridiculous films that actually worked. It's a fun ride start to finish. Final fun fact; the actual taxidermied bear can be found at the Kentucky Fun Mall in Kentucky USA."
5,"You don't need a lengthy analysis or someone to recap the film here...you already know this is ""Cocaine Bear!"" Anything else can spoil the movie experience. I am certain this will be a HUGE hit. They may already be working on sequels. Allow me to suggest:
Cocaine Bear 2: Mushroom Bear (Trippin' on psilocybin)Cocaine Bear 3: Molly Bear (Luvs everybody)Cocaine Bear 4: Cannabis Bear (Uncontrollable munchies)Cocaine Bear 5: Viagra Bear (self-explanatory)The title pretty much tells you what kind of movie to expect and delivers as promised. If you expect too much ...then you may be disappointed, but I don't think anyone who is going to see this film is expecting an Oscar-worthy meaningful masterpiece. Yeah, I guess the movie could have been better (definitely not a 10-star film), but compared to other things in this category; I think it's above average and effort was made to produce something entertaining.I predict the ""Cocaine Bear"" films will become quite a successful franchise. I'm actually kicking myself right now and thinking: ""Why didn't I come up with this first?!"""
6,"Give Elizabeth Banks an award for bringing funny back to the movies. If Tom Cruise & Top Gun saved the movies last year, Elizabeth saved comedies this year. Don't go in looking for a drama. Go in and leave your brains at the door.It takes a lot for me to laugh with tears, but I did with this movie. It was stupid, silly, fun, unbelievable and just plain laugh-out loud funny.Now I don't know if cocaine can have that effect on a bear. But I really don't care. The funniest scene was when the bear fell on the guy and the ""he"" we thought the bear was, turned out to be a ""she."" And how did he know? Because the VayVay was sitting on his head. Whoever wrote that scene needs a writers award."
7,"'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama."
8,"...And it's very good at being just that.Granted, I really didn't expect a lot from a film called Cocaine Bear. What I did expect was some satisfying creature violence and some darkly humorous comedy to pad the time between the carnage. And the film 100% delivered on these fronts.I truly appreciated that the script wasted no time. We get to see our titular monster bear in action from the opening scene, then we get the bear minimum (pun intended) of character exposition for all the people who may or may not get mauled, and we're off to the races for more bloody fun.And oh, it's pretty fun. The CGI for the bear is shockingly good at times, and the gore is always impressive. It's not shown all the time, which was smart of them. It's only really shown at brief moments for maximum shock. Elizabeth Banks actually does have a knack for this, as it turns out. Color me pleasantly surprised.Of course, not all the characters get to shine. Would you expect them to? Most of them are pretty disposable. But even the inconsequential ones get fun personalities and all the actors give it their all and are clearly having fun, no matter how small their roles.What did surprise me most was that the film actually does give the true lead characters some heartfelt beats and emotional lessons that they take away from their horrific day in the woods.One man learns to appreciate his friends amidst his grief, another learns to stand up for what's right, a mother and daughter learn to prioritise each other, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking or powerful by any means, but it did make me feel something.And I truly did not expect a movie called Cocaine Bear to make me feel anything. The film won't be a timeless classic, but it's a really good time at the movies.And Y'know what? If it's not trying to be anything other than that, I'm perfectly happy with it."
9,"Cocaine Bear offers little beyond the trailers in terms of originality, flashiness, or cleverness, but it does offer more of the same...and a lot of it. Chances are, however you interpret the trailers and however you feel about them will determine how you enjoy this movie. If you're ready for a leave-your-brain-at-home 80's adventure of slasher gore (sans human antagonist) and some corny punchlines, then this is your ticket. I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice? If you like the trailer, see it in theaters. If you were indifferent about the trailer, wait until it hits streaming."
10,"This movie was bonkers of fun I saw a little after 5pm Thursday and was wildly entertained! Plenty of shock value, hilarious behavior, brutal, solid dialogue, the bear madness was insane and the cinematography was incredibly done. A bold fun movie by Elizabeth Banks that should be considered a hit! An interesting final role for Ray Liotta being a villain and looked rough I'm sure the entire crew was happy to work with him regardless. I absolutely loved Cocaine Bear I'll want to own it when available. O' Shea Jackson, Isaiah Whitlock JR, Keri Russel, Aldren Ehrenreich and The Bear were all fantastic!Come on my review isn't that bad and the movie is great fun. I have autism and I tend to enjoy more cinema than most besides I was anticipating Cocaine Bear for at least a year I wasn't disappointed at all."
11,"Cocaine Bear is a film that has a good deal of fun with its amazingly hilarious premise, yet ultimately fails to capture that magic all throughout. The titular bear is therefore its best attribute. Beyond a great design and convincing CGI, the picture's utilization of the creature is often very entertaining in its comedic and more intense moments. Of the other roles, Whitlock Jr and Martindale particularly stand out. Both have great timing, while also enjoying the best dialogue of the entire ensemble. Unfortunately, the screenplay fails each remaining cast member. There are simply too many characters and subplots, leading to shallow, paint-by-numbers character development. A great deal of dialogue holds no weight, either, between an overall mixed humor and emotional plays that fall completely flat. The abundance of storylines affects the editing, as well, although that itself suffers from misplaced jump scares and likely showing just a bit too much unnecessary gore. Nevertheless, Cocaine Bear is a recommendable comedy for fans to the genre. Rest in Peace Ray Liotta."
12,The story is very simple; a cocaine shipment falls in the wrong place (a National Park) and a bear eat it and become very very excited and violent. Obviously the drug dealers are looking for it; but there a couple of kids lost and their mother trying to find them.To my surprise; originally looked like a campy B horror movie; it was a really a very well acted comedy (well a black one) with some very violent scenes and impressive (and very gory) special effects.Based on real events; the movie (obviously many things are imagined) the movie tris to avoid the DUMB POEPLE humor but using not good but not really that bad characters.O'Shea Jackson Jr. Is incredible funny as drug dealer that try to look more bad that really is. Alden Ehrenreich is also good as a gay man sweeping because of his lost lover. Ray Liotta in his last performance is the more serious but still very good.But there also a lot secondary characters that make the movie even funnier. The ambulance chase scene is outstanding but there several others almost as good.In brief: there is some gore but the is really really fun to watch and never boriing.
13,"I just got out of Cocaine Bear.This movie was awful. I was hoping for a 'so bad it's good' type of movie, where I laugh at the absurdity of it all, as giant bear that has done cocaine rips everybody apart!! You know a nice bit of gore/comedy. It even failed on that level. I didn't laugh once, it's just plain bad. I had more fun with the three Sharknado movies, let that sink in!!It's not funny, it's not intense and it's not scary. I spent most of my time trying to figure out where I knew the mother from (It's the Bon Jovi music video for Always) likewise her daughter (She was the young girl in The Turning)At one point I checked my watch to see how long was left, as nothing seemed to be happening, and it was only half an hour in. I thought it was at least double that.We spend time with a bunch of human characters, that I just didn't care about, so there was no stakes at all. Ray Liotta is there The guy who played Han Solo in Solo has a bigger role as his son. Jesse Tyler Fergurson (from Modern Family) has a small role, but the standout for me was Margo Metindale as the ranger. But it is a low bar, as the acting is not great.There was one Sly Stallone related thing, that I waited to see if there was a pay off to, but there wasn't!! I was more bothered about that, than any of the human characters.It's dialogue is cringe, the violence is tame and nothing to wrote home about, at all and it's not funny. The trailer suggested a dark horror comedy. This movie did not live up to the trailer .As for Elizabeth Banks.... I preferred Charlies AngelsAn unfunny (I'm not sure of it was trying to be, but the actors seemed to think they were in a comedy, based on the performances) badly edited, dull, waste of talent and time. This goes on my worst of the year list."
14,"I understand that when you make a movie like 'Cocaine Bear' you can't take yourself too seriously or else it will be a death sentence for your movie. There is a way to make a film silly fun without making it completely unbearable (I'm sorry) for anyone above 11 years old to enjoy, however. And this film did not do that.I love comedy-horror when it's done right. I've found the key to getting these films right though is the humour. The horror elements will always be hit and miss, but if the audience is laughing along the way then they will forgive the imperfections in the horror. I didn't laugh once during 'Cocaine Bear'. The editing was very strange. It kept stepping on all the jokes. Every time a line that could've potentially been funny came up it would quickly cut to the next scene before it had time to breathe, almost as if the film was embarrassed by the standard of the joke.So when its not funny you only really have the bear scenes to look forward to. There are some decent kills I will give the movie credit for that. It wasn't afraid to be quite brutal at times. But the CGI of the bear looked awful and really took me out of a lot of scenes.I didn't go into 'Cocaine Bear' expecting a masterpiece, but I also didn't go in expecting to be checking my watch multiple times during a 95 minute film. This was a disappointing effort. 4/10."
15,"This was a fun ride for the first little while, but they shouldn't have shoehorned in a villain-arc in the later half. It was too much story for the ludicrous premise to support.We also really needed to see more of the kids being outrageous, and we DEFINITELY needed more of Margo Martindale's park ranger! What a waste of an incredible talent!The film would have been a lot better if it focused on her and the kids instead of following Keri Russell's blandly forgettable nurse around, not to mention the crooks whose entire story-arc felt wholly unnecessary.5/10 Stars. I enjoyed the opening and most of the first half, but was bored to tears by the end."
16,"If you hear that the actress who played Effie in the Hunger Games movies has directed a flick in which a forest animal goes on a coked-up rampage, you'll probably think that there's some sort of joke going around. Well fear not. Elizabeth Banks's ""Cocaine Bear"" knows exactly what kind of movie it is and then some. In addition to the plot - loosely based on a real incident - we get some references to '80s pop culture (as well as the era's drug scare).And of course there's the cast. In addition to the CGI ursine star, we have Keri Russell, Brooklynn Prince (of ""The Florida Project""), Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son), and Ray Liotta in his final role. Basically, this is one movie that you're bound to enjoy. This plus the miniseries ""Black Bird"" jointly constituted an outstanding end to Ray Liotta's career.In conclusion, the odds were definitely in Elizabeth Banks's favor!"
17,"I was wrong. Other than a few good gore scenes, which is why I scored above a 1, this thing is horrible. I think I might have chuckled once, which perhaps garners half a star, but other than that, I didn't find any comedy in this at all. You'll laugh harder watching 'Goodfellas', one of Liotta's decent works (among many).I didn't realize there was going to be some focus on kid actors, and as hard as they tried, they simply weren't funny, but they probably weren't given anything funny to work with. Certainly 'Sandlot' proves you can make a kid-centric comedy, so it's not the kids' fault. As for the adults, couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. The movie would have been far more interesting if they all had met their demise at the paws of the bear.So basically, there wasn't enough comedy for the comedy fans, enough gore for the gore fans, and no discernible drama for the drama fans. Essentially, this was a bunch of you've-seen-this-before scenes with an occasional bear attack. I will say the bear looked good. Huge disappointment."
18,"I had such a fun experience with this movie! Please go see it with all your friends, and it'll make the experience that much better, or at least see it with a large crowd. The movie kinda starts a little slow because we're getting to meet and know all the characters, but the movie kicks in to high gear soon as the bear gets her cocaine fix.You'll meet Sari, a mom who's trying to do right by her daughter, Dee Dee. Dee Dee and her friend, Henry decide to skip school and go explore the woods. Tracking down the cocaine are Daveed and Eddie. Eddie is the son of a major drug dealer named Syd (Played by the late Ray Liotta. Hot on their trail is an aged cop named Bob. Sari meets up with Rangers Liz and Peter in hopes of finding her daughter and friend. Got all that?Now is where the fun begins! The bear finds bags of cocaine that was dropped from a plane and starts eating it and begins going crazy and has a rampage all over town. The ambulance scene was one of the best parts of the film. The film is gory, cheesy, campy, and fun; everything it sets out to do. So far, this has been of the better movies of 2023 and destined to become a cult classic. I would highly recommend COCAINE BEAR!!!"
19,"I love cheesy low budget movies. The low budget usually means the film makers need to get creative with what they do have and that can lead to some wild ,fun movies. Unfortunately, if they don't get creative, then you're stuck with a movie that is hard to watch.Cocaine Bear has it's bright spots. It's a great premise for a movie. There are a few good scenes that grab your attention or make you laugh. But there's too much dead space. It feels like they had a few good key scenes in mind, like the ambulance scene, and then just wrote the rest of the movie around them. So you have a few cool scenes and the rest is just filler.That's really sad because making a movie called Cocaine Bear a fun entertaining movie should have been a slam dunk. Hollywood had made cheesy, low budget Nature Goes Haywire type movies for decades. Some of them are drek. But some are entertaining. The creators had plenty of moves to choose from to give them an idea of how this type of film works.I do want to give a shout out to Jesse Tyler Ferguson He got into the spirit of the thing and his character was fun. But overall there were just too many gaps between anything fun or interesting. Cocaine Bear just didn't get me high enough."
20,"Yh I knew this was Going to Happen. Sigh 😔.Problems with this Movie -1. The Feel of the Movie is Flat as Hell.2. The First Half of the Movie is Boring as Hell.3. The Bathroom Fight was Unspeakably Bad.4. It Takes too Long to Get Going. And the when it does get going, it's not good enough.5. Almost All of the Jokes Don't Land.6. Almost All of the Characters are Boring as Hell.The 2 Good Things I Liked -1. The Ambulance Scene 🚑2. The Detective on Top of the Wooden Building, Shoots Off the 2 Fingers Scene.Overall, it's basically a waste of time to watch this Movie 👎. Not Making it an Unfunny Comedy would of Probably been a Better Choice."
21,"Cocaine Bear unfortunately doesn't completely live up to its terrific premise, taking way too long to actually get going with too many characters. Thankfully it's still good enough with just enough moments that get it right combined with its ability to get you to actually care about its characters.The cast are all fine, able to do their parts well but it's O'Shea Jackson Jr. And Alden Ehrenreich who are by far the best characters and the most fun to spend time with thanks to their consistently enjoyable back and forth and surprisingly emotional journey.Elizabeth Banks' direction is good overall, it's competently shot and there's enough moments that are cleverly self aware enough to cancel out the lack of tension and missed opportunities. The CG isn't amazing but the bear looks convincing enough."
22,"Inspired by the 1985 true story of a drug runner's plane crash, missing cocaine, and the black bear that ate it, this wild dark comedy finds an oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converging in a Georgia forest where a 500- pound apex predator has ingested a staggering amount of cocaine and gone on a coke-fueled rampage for more blow... and blood.Starring Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, and Ray Liotta in one of his final roles, Cocaine Bear manages to do a disservice to every single one of them. Russell, known for her talents on television in The Americans, a gripping thriller that displays the actress' immense talents, manages to convey little of that skill or charm here. While not fully her fault (she's served with a script that's dead on arrival), this movie may prove to be one of her worst performances to date. Playing Sari (there isn't a character in this film that has a full first and last name), the mother of a child who's gone missing in the same woods the eponymous coked out bear is rampaging in, Russell has little to do other than fret and cast about the forest in search of her daughter.Likewise with O'Shea Jackson Jr. As Daveed, a member of the local drug ring tasked with retrieving the lost product. Jackson's rapport with Alden Ehrenreich may be the best thing about the movie; the two have decent chemistry together, and in a world where the actors were given substantial roles and parts with actual depth, some magic could've been made. The real shame comes with this being one of the final on screen performances of Ray Liotta. Known best for his work on Scorsese's Goodfellas, Liotta's career was always one of hits and misses, but the movie makes for a sad note to begin a career ending run on.Directed by Elizabeth Banks, Cocaine Bear makes for her third directorial feature. There's signs of promise with Banks, but sadly due to being restricted with such lackluster material it doesn't provide her with the ability to fully spread her wings. Still, the film's pacing keeps things moving at a quick clip, throwing the audience right into the thick of it early and doing what it can to keep the energy up. The script, written by Jimmy Warden, is far and away the weakest point of the entire production. Paper-thin characters, undercooked plot lines, and terrible dialogue make this movie borderline unbearable.Overall, Cocaine Bear, while fun in concept, is an unsalvageable film. From subpar acting to lackluster directing, the end result is a funny short story stretched out over 95 agonizing minutes. Neither plot line has enough meat to last the entire film and somehow both combined still can't stretch to create a compelling enough narrative when the bear is off screen. While the bear itself warrants laughs during its blow-fueled quest for more cocaine, the human element is what holds the story back from being anything worthwhile. At best, this is a Friday night movie with friends after multiple drinks."
23,"I really wanted to like this movie but I just can't. I was hoping for some sort of non stop crazed coked out bear but what I really got was just boring.After the opening bit we get 30 minutes of drawn out ""set up"" which wouldn't be too bad except there was no pay off.I might have chuckled one time during this snooze fest that wasted far too much time on scenes like a lame fight in a bathroom, a police officer and his new dog and a park ranger that is dolling herself up to try to hit on the gayest man in the world.If you've seen the trailer you've seen 90% of the best stuff this had to offer."
24,"Director Elizabeth Banks undoubtedly thought the premise of the movie then, perhaps, laughed and most likely told her cast to just remember that they are making a bear on cocaine flick and have fun. But what did it have to be so...bland.The story is of a real life drug smuggling incident where a ton of cocaine was dropped from the sky and then a bear ingests the bulk of it only to die within minute. This is the germination of the story of weirdos attempting to recover it. Though it takes place in the mid-1980s, the way this is shot and constructed is too modern for the tone it was attempting to set. It buries the flick in a lot of needle drop familiar tunes, which should placate a lot of Gen Xers. But it does so more as a distraction that the idea became anemic somewhere in the middle. It becomes a drawn out skit that is painfully uneven. I found myself sighing how wonderfully funny this could've been. Wasted are the chops of Margo Matindale, Ehren Ehrenreich and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who seem to have lines spoonfed to them in an awkward attempt to make them more human. People don't act this way. And if they do in this universe, perhaps have it boil down to one adventure and not four. You have -- Father/Son/Friend drug dealers, Woman Looking for her kid in the woods, Punks harassing campers as Park Ranger thwarts them, Local cop leaving to investigate where the cocaine disappeared. There is just too much movie here. And EVERYONE cracks wise.All to the truly wasted talent of Keri Russell. She plays a mother who is desperate to find her daughter in this madcapped mess.I'm not sure what Banks's motivation was to make this. Perhaps it was just to make something dumb and fun. It is neither of those. It seems, midway through, to truly take itself too seriously. The cocaine jokes are tiring. We get it, people on cocaine are funny (I guess). That trope is so drained of nuance it was ballsy to attempt to resuscitate it. Instead, this is a bland comedy. Worst that we feel nothing when these despicable people do dumb things and are done away with by the bear.Though only under 100 minutes this felt VERY long. Prologuing it with a joke about Europeans first encountering the bear. Ugh.Make it stop."
