0,"Ummmmm, where do I begin. I didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews. I saw the poster and title and thought, ""I'm definitely watching that."" After seeing it, I can say with confidence that it's exactly what a movie named Cocaine Bear should be.Aside from being an extremely fun and outrageous thriller, this movie is hysterical. I was full-volume laughing frequently. So many parts are the perfect combination of memorable and hilarious. It knows exactly what it's doing.The other thing that made me happy is seeing a studio have the courage to allow the filmmakers to go all out. I compare it to M3gan which was going for a similar tone. But M3gan was toned down to PG-13 so teens could watch. Cocaine Bear is rated R as it absolutely should be. It's not gratuitous but it never feels like it's holding back.I had a blast with this movie. If the title or premise intrigue you, you will most likely be pleased.

1,"This film is exactly what you think it is. It's a bear on cocaine going crazy in the woods. That doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually surprisingly good.It's such a good thriller. You're on the edge of your seat for most of it and when you're not on the edge of your seat, you're laughing your ass off.The cast is actually very unrelated. Keri Russell is phenomenal. Alden Ehrenreich And O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son) are great together and have great chemistry.The production value is so so it is definitely not a super high budget film. But it doesn't look bad. The editing as well done especially during the action scenes and the CGI is actually pretty good."
2,"Cocaine Bear is the story of a bear who takes too much cocaine and does stuff like dance, wiggle, and kill, kill, kill. It has about 12 characters we never delve too deep into but somehow they all end up involved with the bear and there is a lot of death, comedy, and bizarre scenes. The film is incredibly strange as it is not exactly funny, heartwarming, or scary...yet is delves into all three of these and sort of keeps you smiling and kind of bizarrely focused and enjoying yourself. Also, a classic final film for the legendary Ray Liotta - and TBH it's wroth seeing just to see the legendary Ray in his final role."
3,"I first groaned and rolled my eyes when I heard they made a film about a bear on cocaine, named Cocaine Bear. I Googled the name to look for the trailer, and stumbled on the Wikipedia page where I learned this movie is loosely based on actual events, and that's what sold me to give it a watch. If the fact a bear actually found and did cocaine for months isn't funny enough alone to give this film a watch, I don't know what is.I'm just glad the filmmakers and producers took the already hilarious true concept, and made a film just as ridiculously funny. It's been a while I've heard an entire theatre burst out in laughter so many times. The entire film was simply put, comedy gold. The story could've been a little tighter in a few of the subplots, but the casting of the various colorful characters and all their performances made up for any of the writing issues.The 95 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing, and the soundtrack was awesome and spot-on for that era. This truly is one of those rare ridiculous films that actually worked. It's a fun ride start to finish. Final fun fact; the actual taxidermied bear can be found at the Kentucky Fun Mall in Kentucky USA."
4,"What a wild ride! The ""ambulance scene"" alone makes this movie worth a watch. Totally insane, scary, funny and gory. The bear is really well made and most of the scenes with it are bananas. A lot of different characters throughout the movie. They all have their own sub plot but they blend pretty well. When it tends to drag a little bit the bear always pops out for more fun and kills so it's always entertaining and goofy. Great directing, special effects and acting. Most of the easy jokes landed, the whole theatre was laughing out loud the entire movie. A good comedy horror entry. Nothing revolutionary but ultimately a really fun popcorn movie."
5,"You don't need a lengthy analysis or someone to recap the film here...you already know this is ""Cocaine Bear!"" Anything else can spoil the movie experience. I am certain this will be a HUGE hit. They may already be working on sequels. Allow me to suggest:
Cocaine Bear 2: Mushroom Bear (Trippin' on psilocybin)Cocaine Bear 3: Molly Bear (Luvs everybody)Cocaine Bear 4: Cannabis Bear (Uncontrollable munchies)Cocaine Bear 5: Viagra Bear (self-explanatory)The title pretty much tells you what kind of movie to expect and delivers as promised. If you expect too much ...then you may be disappointed, but I don't think anyone who is going to see this film is expecting an Oscar-worthy meaningful masterpiece. Yeah, I guess the movie could have been better (definitely not a 10-star film), but compared to other things in this category; I think it's above average and effort was made to produce something entertaining.I predict the ""Cocaine Bear"" films will become quite a successful franchise. I'm actually kicking myself right now and thinking: ""Why didn't I come up with this first?!"""
6,"Give Elizabeth Banks an award for bringing funny back to the movies. If Tom Cruise & Top Gun saved the movies last year, Elizabeth saved comedies this year. Don't go in looking for a drama. Go in and leave your brains at the door.It takes a lot for me to laugh with tears, but I did with this movie. It was stupid, silly, fun, unbelievable and just plain laugh-out loud funny.Now I don't know if cocaine can have that effect on a bear. But I really don't care. The funniest scene was when the bear fell on the guy and the ""he"" we thought the bear was, turned out to be a ""she."" And how did he know? Because the VayVay was sitting on his head. Whoever wrote that scene needs a writers award."
7,"...And it's very good at being just that.Granted, I really didn't expect a lot from a film called Cocaine Bear. What I did expect was some satisfying creature violence and some darkly humorous comedy to pad the time between the carnage. And the film 100% delivered on these fronts.I truly appreciated that the script wasted no time. We get to see our titular monster bear in action from the opening scene, then we get the bear minimum (pun intended) of character exposition for all the people who may or may not get mauled, and we're off to the races for more bloody fun.And oh, it's pretty fun. The CGI for the bear is shockingly good at times, and the gore is always impressive. It's not shown all the time, which was smart of them. It's only really shown at brief moments for maximum shock. Elizabeth Banks actually does have a knack for this, as it turns out. Color me pleasantly surprised.Of course, not all the characters get to shine. Would you expect them to? Most of them are pretty disposable. But even the inconsequential ones get fun personalities and all the actors give it their all and are clearly having fun, no matter how small their roles.What did surprise me most was that the film actually does give the true lead characters some heartfelt beats and emotional lessons that they take away from their horrific day in the woods.One man learns to appreciate his friends amidst his grief, another learns to stand up for what's right, a mother and daughter learn to prioritise each other, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking or powerful by any means, but it did make me feel something.And I truly did not expect a movie called Cocaine Bear to make me feel anything. The film won't be a timeless classic, but it's a really good time at the movies.And Y'know what? If it's not trying to be anything other than that, I'm perfectly happy with it."
8,"Cocaine Bear offers little beyond the trailers in terms of originality, flashiness, or cleverness, but it does offer more of the same...and a lot of it. Chances are, however you interpret the trailers and however you feel about them will determine how you enjoy this movie. If you're ready for a leave-your-brain-at-home 80's adventure of slasher gore (sans human antagonist) and some corny punchlines, then this is your ticket. I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice? If you like the trailer, see it in theaters. If you were indifferent about the trailer, wait until it hits streaming."
9,"'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama."
10,"This movie was bonkers of fun I saw a little after 5pm Thursday and was wildly entertained! Plenty of shock value, hilarious behavior, brutal, solid dialogue, the bear madness was insane and the cinematography was incredibly done. A bold fun movie by Elizabeth Banks that should be considered a hit! An interesting final role for Ray Liotta being a villain and looked rough I'm sure the entire crew was happy to work with him regardless. I absolutely loved Cocaine Bear I'll want to own it when available. O' Shea Jackson, Isaiah Whitlock JR, Keri Russel, Aldren Ehrenreich and The Bear were all fantastic!Come on my review isn't that bad and the movie is great fun. I have autism and I tend to enjoy more cinema than most besides I was anticipating Cocaine Bear for at least a year I wasn't disappointed at all."
11,"Cocaine Bear is a film that has a good deal of fun with its amazingly hilarious premise, yet ultimately fails to capture that magic all throughout. The titular bear is therefore its best attribute. Beyond a great design and convincing CGI, the picture's utilization of the creature is often very entertaining in its comedic and more intense moments. Of the other roles, Whitlock Jr and Martindale particularly stand out. Both have great timing, while also enjoying the best dialogue of the entire ensemble. Unfortunately, the screenplay fails each remaining cast member. There are simply too many characters and subplots, leading to shallow, paint-by-numbers character development. A great deal of dialogue holds no weight, either, between an overall mixed humor and emotional plays that fall completely flat. The abundance of storylines affects the editing, as well, although that itself suffers from misplaced jump scares and likely showing just a bit too much unnecessary gore. Nevertheless, Cocaine Bear is a recommendable comedy for fans to the genre. Rest in Peace Ray Liotta."
12,"I just got out of Cocaine Bear.This movie was awful. I was hoping for a 'so bad it's good' type of movie, where I laugh at the absurdity of it all, as giant bear that has done cocaine rips everybody apart!! You know a nice bit of gore/comedy. It even failed on that level. I didn't laugh once, it's just plain bad. I had more fun with the three Sharknado movies, let that sink in!!It's not funny, it's not intense and it's not scary. I spent most of my time trying to figure out where I knew the mother from (It's the Bon Jovi music video for Always) likewise her daughter (She was the young girl in The Turning)At one point I checked my watch to see how long was left, as nothing seemed to be happening, and it was only half an hour in. I thought it was at least double that.We spend time with a bunch of human characters, that I just didn't care about, so there was no stakes at all. Ray Liotta is there The guy who played Han Solo in Solo has a bigger role as his son. Jesse Tyler Fergurson (from Modern Family) has a small role, but the standout for me was Margo Metindale as the ranger. But it is a low bar, as the acting is not great.There was one Sly Stallone related thing, that I waited to see if there was a pay off to, but there wasn't!! I was more bothered about that, than any of the human characters.It's dialogue is cringe, the violence is tame and nothing to wrote home about, at all and it's not funny. The trailer suggested a dark horror comedy. This movie did not live up to the trailer .As for Elizabeth Banks.... I preferred Charlies AngelsAn unfunny (I'm not sure of it was trying to be, but the actors seemed to think they were in a comedy, based on the performances) badly edited, dull, waste of talent and time. This goes on my worst of the year list."
13,The story is very simple; a cocaine shipment falls in the wrong place (a National Park) and a bear eat it and become very very excited and violent. Obviously the drug dealers are looking for it; but there a couple of kids lost and their mother trying to find them.To my surprise; originally looked like a campy B horror movie; it was a really a very well acted comedy (well a black one) with some very violent scenes and impressive (and very gory) special effects.Based on real events; the movie (obviously many things are imagined) the movie tris to avoid the DUMB POEPLE humor but using not good but not really that bad characters.O'Shea Jackson Jr. Is incredible funny as drug dealer that try to look more bad that really is. Alden Ehrenreich is also good as a gay man sweeping because of his lost lover. Ray Liotta in his last performance is the more serious but still very good.But there also a lot secondary characters that make the movie even funnier. The ambulance chase scene is outstanding but there several others almost as good.In brief: there is some gore but the is really really fun to watch and never boriing.
14,"If you hear that the actress who played Effie in the Hunger Games movies has directed a flick in which a forest animal goes on a coked-up rampage, you'll probably think that there's some sort of joke going around. Well fear not. Elizabeth Banks's ""Cocaine Bear"" knows exactly what kind of movie it is and then some. In addition to the plot - loosely based on a real incident - we get some references to '80s pop culture (as well as the era's drug scare).And of course there's the cast. In addition to the CGI ursine star, we have Keri Russell, Brooklynn Prince (of ""The Florida Project""), Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son), and Ray Liotta in his final role. Basically, this is one movie that you're bound to enjoy. This plus the miniseries ""Black Bird"" jointly constituted an outstanding end to Ray Liotta's career.In conclusion, the odds were definitely in Elizabeth Banks's favor!"
15,"I understand that when you make a movie like 'Cocaine Bear' you can't take yourself too seriously or else it will be a death sentence for your movie. There is a way to make a film silly fun without making it completely unbearable (I'm sorry) for anyone above 11 years old to enjoy, however. And this film did not do that.I love comedy-horror when it's done right. I've found the key to getting these films right though is the humour. The horror elements will always be hit and miss, but if the audience is laughing along the way then they will forgive the imperfections in the horror. I didn't laugh once during 'Cocaine Bear'. The editing was very strange. It kept stepping on all the jokes. Every time a line that could've potentially been funny came up it would quickly cut to the next scene before it had time to breathe, almost as if the film was embarrassed by the standard of the joke.So when its not funny you only really have the bear scenes to look forward to. There are some decent kills I will give the movie credit for that. It wasn't afraid to be quite brutal at times. But the CGI of the bear looked awful and really took me out of a lot of scenes.I didn't go into 'Cocaine Bear' expecting a masterpiece, but I also didn't go in expecting to be checking my watch multiple times during a 95 minute film. This was a disappointing effort. 4/10."
16,"This was a fun ride for the first little while, but they shouldn't have shoehorned in a villain-arc in the later half. It was too much story for the ludicrous premise to support.We also really needed to see more of the kids being outrageous, and we DEFINITELY needed more of Margo Martindale's park ranger! What a waste of an incredible talent!The film would have been a lot better if it focused on her and the kids instead of following Keri Russell's blandly forgettable nurse around, not to mention the crooks whose entire story-arc felt wholly unnecessary.5/10 Stars. I enjoyed the opening and most of the first half, but was bored to tears by the end."
17,"I had such a fun experience with this movie! Please go see it with all your friends, and it'll make the experience that much better, or at least see it with a large crowd. The movie kinda starts a little slow because we're getting to meet and know all the characters, but the movie kicks in to high gear soon as the bear gets her cocaine fix.You'll meet Sari, a mom who's trying to do right by her daughter, Dee Dee. Dee Dee and her friend, Henry decide to skip school and go explore the woods. Tracking down the cocaine are Daveed and Eddie. Eddie is the son of a major drug dealer named Syd (Played by the late Ray Liotta. Hot on their trail is an aged cop named Bob. Sari meets up with Rangers Liz and Peter in hopes of finding her daughter and friend. Got all that?Now is where the fun begins! The bear finds bags of cocaine that was dropped from a plane and starts eating it and begins going crazy and has a rampage all over town. The ambulance scene was one of the best parts of the film. The film is gory, cheesy, campy, and fun; everything it sets out to do. So far, this has been of the better movies of 2023 and destined to become a cult classic. I would highly recommend COCAINE BEAR!!!"
18,"Cocaine Bear unfortunately doesn't completely live up to its terrific premise, taking way too long to actually get going with too many characters. Thankfully it's still good enough with just enough moments that get it right combined with its ability to get you to actually care about its characters.The cast are all fine, able to do their parts well but it's O'Shea Jackson Jr. And Alden Ehrenreich who are by far the best characters and the most fun to spend time with thanks to their consistently enjoyable back and forth and surprisingly emotional journey.Elizabeth Banks' direction is good overall, it's competently shot and there's enough moments that are cleverly self aware enough to cancel out the lack of tension and missed opportunities. The CG isn't amazing but the bear looks convincing enough."
19,"Yh I knew this was Going to Happen. Sigh 😔.Problems with this Movie -1. The Feel of the Movie is Flat as Hell.2. The First Half of the Movie is Boring as Hell.3. The Bathroom Fight was Unspeakably Bad.4. It Takes too Long to Get Going. And the when it does get going, it's not good enough.5. Almost All of the Jokes Don't Land.6. Almost All of the Characters are Boring as Hell.The 3 Good Things I Liked -1. The Ambulance Scene 🚑2. The Detective on Top of the Wooden Building Scene.3. The Detective.Overall, it's basically a waste of time to watch this Movie 👎. Not Making it an Unfunny Comedy would of Probably been a Better Choice."
20,"I love cheesy low budget movies. The low budget usually means the film makers need to get creative with what they do have and that can lead to some wild ,fun movies. Unfortunately, if they don't get creative, then you're stuck with a movie that is hard to watch.Cocaine Bear has it's bright spots. It's a great premise for a movie. There are a few good scenes that grab your attention or make you laugh. But there's too much dead space. It feels like they had a few good key scenes in mind, like the ambulance scene, and then just wrote the rest of the movie around them. So you have a few cool scenes and the rest is just filler.That's really sad because making a movie called Cocaine Bear a fun entertaining movie should have been a slam dunk. Hollywood had made cheesy, low budget Nature Goes Haywire type movies for decades. Some of them are drek. But some are entertaining. The creators had plenty of moves to choose from to give them an idea of how this type of film works.I do want to give a shout out to Jesse Tyler Ferguson He got into the spirit of the thing and his character was fun. But overall there were just too many gaps between anything fun or interesting. Cocaine Bear just didn't get me high enough."
21,"Cocaine bear was the greatest movie of all time. From the exhilarating start with the death of the hippie couple, the movie never slowed down. It kicks off with the introduction of the characters, which each of them is deeply woven into this conflict in the most ironic and comedic way possible. Each side of the plot, the cocaine bear, by which this glorious piece of film is named after, the children, the mother, the park ranger, the drug dealers, and the police, have their own unique goals by which dictates their characterization. The plot slowly rises until the beautiful scene at the gazebo, where all the plot-lines crash together, the dramatic irony is relieved, and the characters are forced to reconcile their differences and revel in their common goal, avoiding the cocaine bear. However, this scene is only the second best of all time. The best scene of all time comes at the cave, where the mother and the children resolve their problems, however, with the resolution of problems comes the introduction of new ones. The people with the drug cartel come to retrieve their cocaine, and are stopped when the baby cocaine bears leave them felted. Soon, they realize their blunder. Mama bear is there for her children. The younger people within the group of drug dealers say to leave, yet the stalwart old man tries to hold onto the system. The way things are done. Caring only about the cocaine (representing the material things within this world) and not the children and her mother (representing love and care of others), the young, the mother, and the children jump out of an opening in the cave, and leave the old man in his pursuit of material things. Yet the old man persists, and the cocaine bear, representing the wrath of God, destroys him for his materialism and selfishness. And those who are righteous escape and all live. So overall, this movie juxtaposes between the idea that people are predisposed to the goals of their own group, and the idea that men can ascend beyond their dispositions and become righteous. Eventually, the righteousness win, and those responsible for the perpetuation of evil are destroyed. This beautiful resolution of the film cements it as the greatest movie of all time, woven with tragedy, comedy, and drama. Cocaine bear is the greatest movie of all time. Better than Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and any silly and futile film you might name. As ultimately, man's escape from his own foreordained state of mind will result in ascension, and all that watch this film will have their jaws dropping in awe as they come to this earth shattering and glorious conclusion."
22,"The first waste of time movie seen at the cinema and I didn't even want to watch it, but I got roped into seeing it with a friend and so here I am.This will be short as I just do not care to talk about this film in any real depth as it has none to begin with.Now you don't go to the cinema and watch something called Cocaine Bear and expect a master piece but goodness is this film desperate to be entertaining and funny, which it most definitely is not.The characters are inconsequential and uninteresting but the actors give good performances, hell even the child actors performed well but the characters are just who cares.But it's called Cocaine Bear so really I doubt anyone came out for interesting characters but rather came out to see a coked out bear do stupid s**t. Which is precisely what this film provides.The kills are gruesome and pretty funny at times, the bear itself is surprisingly very well done. By that I mean the cgi, it was I must admit really good. From a budget of $35 million that is very impressive. They must've spent $1 mill on cast, crew, and marketing, then $34 mill on the bears cgi as my friend and I joked.Anyway this film provides exactly as advertised and nothing more. But to me this was just boring, stupid, and uninteresting. I don't understand how this passes for entertainment these days but whatever, simply put it's not for me.IMDb: 4/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
23,"From the film's title, you can probably guess that this is a one-joke movie, a premise borne out in the trailer and in the picture itself. But, frankly, who cares? This delightfully campy dark comedy arguably has a few pacing and editing issues, as well as some bits that fall a little flat, but it's generally a filling smorgasbord of over-the-top, goofy, gory fun. Director Elizabeth Banks's third feature outing definitely won't appeal to everyone because of its rampant silliness and its gratuitous shock value that's more than a fitting homage to the cheesy, tacky 1980s slasher movies reminiscent of the time frame in which this fact-based true story is based. In essence, the premise is a simple one: a plane carrying an enormous stash of the powdery white substance crashes in the Chattahoochee National Forest, depositing its cargo within reach of a CGI-generated black bear who immediately becomes hooked on this find and embarks on an out-of-control murderous rampage, taking down an array of characters who have varying connections to the locale, the payload or other related considerations. And, yes, for what it's worth, this soon becomes a one-note narrative, but the note is played differently every time it's struck, with funny little twists and ever-more grisly (but creatively hilarious) imagery thrown in for good measure, the kind of laughs typical of cult classics and the fare of midnight shows. This offering also features fine performances by the likes of Margot Martindale, Christian Convery and the late Ray Liotta in his final screen portrayal, all of whom were good sports in recognizing the high-camp factor of this material. Look, let's face it, drugs are often an inherently funny source of gut-busting humor (more so here literally than in many other cinematic vehicles), so just go with it on that level rather than trying to assess it otherwise - and running the risk of succumbing to the logic contained in the screeds of tiresome, droll, stick-in-the-mud naysayers (as many allegedly esteemed critics have already written about in their dour, dull, joyless, overly somber evaluations). Enjoy this one in the kitschy spirit in which it was intended - and ignore anyone who screams ""just say no."""
24,"Okay, so like many, I believe, I immediately groaned and rolled my eyes. But after watching the trailer I said why not. I used it as my girls night and we went to go see it. When I tell you I was laughing so hard I choked on popcorn it is not an exaggeration.I've gone to see it 3 times in theaters now and honestly it is still as funny and great as the first time I saw it! The cast is hilarious from the small rolls to the larger ones.I NEVER take the time to review anything but this deserve every star I gave it. 10/10 would recommend and I have. Go see it. Please.I believe it to be the film of the year. Hands down!"
