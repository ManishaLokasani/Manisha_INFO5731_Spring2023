            "Ummmmm, where do I begin. I didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews. I saw the poster and title and thought, \"I'm definitely watching that.\" After seeing it, I can say with confidence that it's exactly what a movie named Cocaine Bear should be.Aside from being an extremely fun and outrageous thriller, this movie is hysterical. I was full-volume laughing frequently. So many parts are the perfect combination of memorable and hilarious. It knows exactly what it's doing.The other thing that made me happy is seeing a studio have the courage to allow the filmmakers to go all out. I compare it to M3gan which was going for a similar tone. But M3gan was toned down to PG-13 so teens could watch. Cocaine Bear is rated R as it absolutely should be. It's not gratuitous but it never feels like it's holding back.I had a blast with this movie. If the title or premise intrigue you, you will most likely be pleased. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 2/23/2023)\n",
            "Cocaine Bear promised so much but just didn't hit the spot for me.There are too many characters in my opinion which becomes a bit of a chore and breaks things up a little too much. If there was more of a focus on just a couple of characters as the protagonists it would have been better.The humour didn't always work for me. Sometimes it was good but it fell flat a little too often.The central premise is great but it doesn't go far enough in my opinion. I feel like there was a lot more fun to have with the concept. Although saying that there are some wildly fun and gruesome body horror moments, and the effects on the bear and the injury detail are top notch.Overall a bit of a let down. This film is mostly fun as expected, but the premise wears a little thin come the third act. Not quite the riotous spectacle I was hoping for.\n",
            "I first groaned and rolled my eyes when I heard they made a film about a bear on cocaine, named Cocaine Bear. I Googled the name to look for the trailer, and stumbled on the Wikipedia page where I learned this movie is loosely based on actual events, and that's what sold me to give it a watch. If the fact a bear actually found and did cocaine for months isn't funny enough alone to give this film a watch, I don't know what is.I'm just glad the filmmakers and producers took the already hilarious true concept, and made a film just as ridiculously funny. It's been a while I've heard an entire theatre burst out in laughter so many times. The entire film was simply put, comedy gold. The story could've been a little tighter in a few of the subplots, but the casting of the various colorful characters and all their performances made up for any of the writing issues.The 95 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing, and the soundtrack was awesome and spot-on for that era. This truly is one of those rare ridiculous films that actually worked. It's a fun ride start to finish. Final fun fact; the actual taxidermied bear can be found at the Kentucky Fun Mall in Kentucky USA.\n",
            "If you go down to the woods today you're sure of a big surprise, as mother bear's opened a bag of cocaine and is reaching for the skies, it's made her somewhat volatile and her temper wont abate, if she catches hold she will remould your limbs and amputate.It's not the worst film about a drug addled bear high as a kite on cocaine that you'll come across, and it probably won't be the last, as variations on a theme are bound to come along in multiform. Quite often amusing, with various appendages and body parts being removed by claw and tooth, fine performances all round and it must have been a fun movie to direct and make.\n",
            "This film is exactly what you think it is. It's a bear on cocaine going crazy in the woods. That doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually surprisingly good.It's such a good thriller. You're on the edge of your seat for most of it and when you're not on the edge of your seat, you're laughing your ass off.The cast is actually very unrelated. Keri Russell is phenomenal. Alden Ehrenreich And O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son) are great together and have great chemistry.The production value is so so it is definitely not a super high budget film. But it doesn't look bad. The editing as well done especially during the action scenes and the CGI is actually pretty good.\n",
            "Curious about \"Cocaine bear?\" It could of either been brilliant or terrible, and it is.Those hoping for an over the top, hilarious horror movie that doesn't take itself seriously (like us) will be beyond disappointed. Its like they had a good idea here, and went out of their way to avoid doing it.There are jokes, but they're cringey. There is action. But the CGI is mixed. What there isn't is anything to get invested in. There's all these characters you won't care about. Mostly walking around the woods talking. Then there's the bear. Who gets a couple of good kills in before it passes out.Boring is the worst thing the movie could of been. But some stuff early on in the movie is also done in extremely bad taste. This set the bar low for a cinema audience that maybe laughed once during the rest of the longest hour and a half ever.\n",
            "I was wrong. Other than a few good gore scenes, which is why I scored above a 1, this thing is horrible. I think I might have chuckled once, which perhaps garners half a star, but other than that, I didn't find any comedy in this at all. You'll laugh harder watching 'Goodfellas', one of Liotta's decent works (among many).I didn't realize there was going to be some focus on kid actors, and as hard as they tried, they simply weren't funny, but they probably weren't given anything funny to work with. Certainly 'Sandlot' proves you can make a kid-centric comedy, so it's not the kids' fault. As for the adults, couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. The movie would have been far more interesting if they all had met their demise at the paws of the bear.So basically, there wasn't enough comedy for the comedy fans, enough gore for the gore fans, and no discernible drama for the drama fans. Essentially, this was a bunch of you've-seen-this-before scenes with an occasional bear attack. I will say the bear looked good. Huge disappointment.\n",
            "I just got out of Cocaine Bear.This movie was awful. I was hoping for a 'so bad it's good' type of movie, where I laugh at the absurdity of it all, as giant bear that has done cocaine rips everybody apart!! You know a nice bit of gore/comedy. It even failed on that level. I didn't laugh once, it's just plain bad. I had more fun with the three Sharknado movies, let that sink in!!It's not funny, it's not intense and it's not scary. I spent most of my time trying to figure out where I knew the mother from (It's the Bon Jovi music video for Always) likewise her daughter (She was the young girl in The Turning)At one point I checked my watch to see how long was left, as nothing seemed to be happening, and it was only half an hour in. I thought it was at least double that.We spend time with a bunch of human characters, that I just didn't care about, so there was no stakes at all. Ray Liotta is there The guy who played Han Solo in Solo has a bigger role as his son. Jesse Tyler Fergurson (from Modern Family) has a small role, but the standout for me was Margo Metindale as the ranger. But it is a low bar, as the acting is not great.There was one Sly Stallone related thing, that I waited to see if there was a pay off to, but there wasn't!! I was more bothered about that, than any of the human characters.It's dialogue is cringe, the violence is tame and nothing to wrote home about, at all and it's not funny. The trailer suggested a dark horror comedy. This movie did not live up to the trailer .As for Elizabeth Banks.... I preferred Charlies AngelsAn unfunny (I'm not sure of it was trying to be, but the actors seemed to think they were in a comedy, based on the performances) badly edited, dull, waste of talent and time. This goes on my worst of the year list.\n",
            "'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama.\n",
            "I really wanted to like this movie but I just can't. I was hoping for some sort of non stop crazed coked out bear but what I really got was just boring.After the opening bit we get 30 minutes of drawn out \"set up\" which wouldn't be too bad except there was no pay off.I might have chuckled one time during this snooze fest that wasted far too much time on scenes like a lame fight in a bathroom, a police officer and his new dog and a park ranger that is dolling herself up to try to hit on the gayest man in the world.If you've seen the trailer you've seen 90% of the best stuff this had to offer.\n",
            "Cocaine Bear is the story of a bear who takes too much cocaine and does stuff like dance, wiggle, and kill, kill, kill. It has about 12 characters we never delve too deep into but somehow they all end up involved with the bear and there is a lot of death, comedy, and bizarre scenes. The film is incredibly strange as it is not exactly funny, heartwarming, or scary...yet is delves into all three of these and sort of keeps you smiling and kind of bizarrely focused and enjoying yourself. Also, a classic final film for the legendary Ray Liotta - and TBH it's wroth seeing just to see the legendary Ray in his final role.\n",
            "After watching the full movie I realised that the two minutes long intro tells everything that happens. And nothing else really does happen. Visuals: could've been better, Storyline: second to none, Casting: okay-ish, Characters: not elaborate, Horror factor: basic, grade E+, Funniness: might contain some easy to digest jokes, but that's all. If this is a primarily horror movie, it should've been more frightening and unpredictable. If primarily a comedy, should've been way more funnier. It just fails at both, and I'm sad to say (maybe I had too high expectations), but this is a missed shot again.\n",
            "What a wild ride! The \"ambulance scene\" alone makes this movie worth a watch. Totally insane, scary, funny and gory. The bear is really well made and most of the scenes with it are bananas. A lot of different characters throughout the movie. They all have their own sub plot but they blend pretty well. When it tends to drag a little bit the bear always pops out for more fun and kills so it's always entertaining and goofy. Great directing, special effects and acting. Most of the easy jokes landed, the whole theatre was laughing out loud the entire movie. A good comedy horror entry. Nothing revolutionary but ultimately a really fun popcorn movie.\n",
            "Cocaine Bear offers little beyond the trailers in terms of originality, flashiness, or cleverness, but it does offer more of the same...and a lot of it. Chances are, however you interpret the trailers and however you feel about them will determine how you enjoy this movie. If you're ready for a leave-your-brain-at-home 80's adventure of slasher gore (sans human antagonist) and some corny punchlines, then this is your ticket. I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice? If you like the trailer, see it in theaters. If you were indifferent about the trailer, wait until it hits streaming.\n",
            "Come for the \"Cocaine\" ...stay for the \"Bear.\" I am certain this will be a HUGE hit. They may already be working on sequels. Allow me to suggest:Cocaine Bear 2: Mushroom Bear (Trippin' on psilocybin)Cocaine Bear 3: Molly Bear (Luvs everybody)Cocaine Bear 4: Cannabis Bear (Uncontrollable munchies)Cocaine Bear 5: Viagra Bear (self-explanatory)The title pretty much tells you what kind of movie to expect and delivers as promised. If you expect too much ...then you may be disappointed, but I don't think anyone who is going to see this film is expecting an Oscar-worthy meaningful masterpiece. Yeah, I guess the movie could have been better (definitely not a 10-star film), but compared to other things in this category; I think it's above average and effort was made to produce something entertaining.I predict the \"Cocaine Bear\" films will become quite a successful franchise. I'm actually kicking myself right now and thinking: \"Why didn't I come up with this first?!\"\n",
            "Yh I knew this was Going to Happen. Sigh 😔.Problems with this Movie -1. The Feel of the Movie is Flat as Hell.2. The First Half of the Movie is Boring as Hell.3. The Bathroom Fight was Unspeakably Bad.4. It Takes too Long to Get Going. And the when it does get going, it's not good enough.5. Almost All of the Jokes Don't Land.6. Almost All of the Characters are Boring as Hell.The 2 Good Things I Liked -1. The Ambulance Scene 🚑2. The Detective on Top of the Wooden Building, Shoots Off the 2 Fingers Scene.Overall, it's basically a waste of time to watch this Movie 👎. Not Making it an Unfunny Comedy would of Probably been a Better Choice.\n",
            "I understand that when you make a movie like 'Cocaine Bear' you can't take yourself too seriously or else it will be a death sentence for your movie. There is a way to make a film silly fun without making it completely unbearable (I'm sorry) for anyone above 11 years old to enjoy, however. And this film did not do that.I love comedy-horror when it's done right. I've found the key to getting these films right though is the humour. The horror elements will always be hit and miss, but if the audience is laughing along the way then they will forgive the imperfections in the horror. I didn't laugh once during 'Cocaine Bear'. The editing was very strange. It kept stepping on all the jokes. Every time a line that could've potentially been funny came up it would quickly cut to the next scene before it had time to breathe, almost as if the film was embarrassed by the standard of the joke.So when its not funny you only really have the bear scenes to look forward to. There are some decent kills I will give the movie credit for that. It wasn't afraid to be quite brutal at times. But the CGI of the bear looked awful and really took me out of a lot of scenes.I didn't go into 'Cocaine Bear' expecting a masterpiece, but I also didn't go in expecting to be checking my watch multiple times during a 95 minute film. This was a disappointing effort. 4/10.\n",
            "I love cheesy low budget movies. The low budget usually means the film makers need to get creative with what they do have and that can lead to some wild ,fun movies. Unfortunately, if they don't get creative, then you're stuck with a movie that is hard to watch.Cocaine Bear has it's bright spots. It's a great premise for a movie. There are a few good scenes that grab your attention or make you laugh. But there's too much dead space. It feels like they had a few good key scenes in mind, like the ambulance scene, and then just wrote the rest of the movie around them. So you have a few cool scenes and the rest is just filler.That's really sad because making a movie called Cocaine Bear a fun entertaining movie should have been a slam dunk. Hollywood had made cheesy, low budget Nature Goes Haywire type movies for decades. Some of them are drek. But some are entertaining. The creators had plenty of moves to choose from to give them an idea of how this type of film works.I do want to give a shout out to Jesse Tyler Ferguson He got into the spirit of the thing and his character was fun. But overall there were just too many gaps between anything fun or interesting. Cocaine Bear just didn't get me high enough.\n",
            "What a terrible movie. So glad my friend paid for my ticket. The trailer makes it out to be about a bear who ate cocaine and went on a rampage. But what the trailers doesn't show is you instead get introduced to endless characters and most of the movie becomes about random people.From drug dealers, to a ranger to others. You \"bearly\" get to see the bear at all. Which ends up making the movie beyond boring. Unless you want to see the stories of all these people.Admittedly I had no expectation for this movie. I knew I was lose brain cells watching it. If you want a horror movie, go watch something else. If you want to save yourself time, just read the actual story of the cocaine bear. Sure, the story is short, stupid and no interesting. But its still better then this movie. Hollywood is out of ideas.\n",
            "The first waste of time movie seen at the cinema and I didn't even want to watch it, but I got roped into seeing it with a friend and so here I am.This will be short as I just do not care to talk about this film in any real depth as it has none to begin with.Now you don't go to the cinema and watch something called Cocaine Bear and expect a master piece but goodness is this film desperate to be entertaining and funny, which it most definitely is not.The characters are inconsequential and uninteresting but the actors give good performances, hell even the child actors performed well but the characters are just who cares.But it's called Cocaine Bear so really I doubt anyone came out for interesting characters but rather came out to see a coked out bear do stupid s**t. Which is precisely what this film provides.The kills are gruesome and pretty funny at times, the bear itself is surprisingly very well done. By that I mean the cgi, it was I must admit really good. From a budget of $35 million that is very impressive. They must've spent $1 mill on cast, crew, and marketing, then $34 mill on the bears cgi as my friend and I joked.Anyway this film provides exactly as advertised and nothing more. But to me this was just boring, stupid, and uninteresting. I don't understand how this passes for entertainment these days but whatever, simply put it's not for me.IMDb: 4/10\n",
            "Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.\n",
            "This was a fun ride for the first little while, but they shouldn't have shoehorned in a villain-arc in the later half. It was too much story for the ludicrous premise to support.We also really needed to see more of the kids being outrageous, and we DEFINITELY needed more of Margo Martindale's park ranger! What a waste of an incredible talent!The film would have been a lot better if it focused on her and the kids instead of following Keri Russell's blandly forgettable nurse around, not to mention the crooks whose entire story-arc felt wholly unnecessary.5/10 Stars. I enjoyed the opening and most of the first half, but was bored to tears by the end.\n",
            "Movie wasn't scary or funny, and ultimately just a huge waste of time.Gore was pretty subdued, often cutting away from the gnarliest parts so the film has failed as a horror/gore fest.Humor was SNL levels of schlocky funny faces, movie couldn't really land a single joke. Movie was completely spineless, afraid of it's own rating.Instead of watching a fun horror comedy, you are stuck with about an hour of dumb character development, a mother and daughter bonding, friends becoming friends, and some incredibly lame sub plot about overcoming grief.This movie took a creative premise and somehow managed to make the most streamlined hollywood cash grab I have seen in years.\n",
            "Director Elizabeth Banks undoubtedly thought the premise of the movie then, perhaps, laughed and most likely told her cast to just remember that they are making a bear on cocaine flick and have fun. But what did it have to be so...bland.The story is of a real life drug smuggling incident where a ton of cocaine was dropped from the sky and then a bear ingests the bulk of it only to die within minute. This is the germination of the story of weirdos attempting to recover it. Though it takes place in the mid-1980s, the way this is shot and constructed is too modern for the tone it was attempting to set. It buries the flick in a lot of needle drop familiar tunes, which should placate a lot of Gen Xers. But it does so more as a distraction that the idea became anemic somewhere in the middle. It becomes a drawn out skit that is painfully uneven. I found myself sighing how wonderfully funny this could've been. Wasted are the chops of Margo Matindale, Ehren Ehrenreich and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who seem to have lines spoonfed to them in an awkward attempt to make them more human. People don't act this way. And if they do in this universe, perhaps have it boil down to one adventure and not four. You have -- Father/Son/Friend drug dealers, Woman Looking for her kid in the woods, Punks harassing campers as Park Ranger thwarts them, Local cop leaving to investigate where the cocaine disappeared. There is just too much movie here. And EVERYONE cracks wise.All to the truly wasted talent of Keri Russell. She plays a mother who is desperate to find her daughter in this madcapped mess.I'm not sure what Banks's motivation was to make this. Perhaps it was just to make something dumb and fun. It is neither of those. It seems, midway through, to truly take itself too seriously. The cocaine jokes are tiring. We get it, people on cocaine are funny (I guess). That trope is so drained of nuance it was ballsy to attempt to resuscitate it. Instead, this is a bland comedy. Worst that we feel nothing when these despicable people do dumb things and are done away with by the bear.Though only under 100 minutes this felt VERY long. Prologuing it with a joke about Europeans first encountering the bear. Ugh.Make it stop.\n",
            "...And it's very good at being just that.Granted, I really didn't expect a lot from a film called Cocaine Bear. What I did expect was some satisfying creature violence and some darkly humorous comedy to pad the time between the carnage. And the film 100% delivered on these fronts.I truly appreciated that the script wasted no time. We get to see our titular monster bear in action from the opening scene, then we get the bear minimum (pun intended) of character exposition for all the people who may or may not get mauled, and we're off to the races for more bloody fun.And oh, it's pretty fun. The CGI for the bear is shockingly good at times, and the gore is always impressive. It's not shown all the time, which was smart of them. It's only really shown at brief moments for maximum shock. Elizabeth Banks actually does have a knack for this, as it turns out. Color me pleasantly surprised.Of course, not all the characters get to shine. Would you expect them to? Most of them are pretty disposable. But even the inconsequential ones get fun personalities and all the actors give it their all and are clearly having fun, no matter how small their roles.What did surprise me most was that the film actually does give the true lead characters some heartfelt beats and emotional lessons that they take away from their horrific day in the woods.One man learns to appreciate his friends amidst his grief, another learns to stand up for what's right, a mother and daughter learn to prioritise each other, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking or powerful by any means, but it did make me feel something.And I truly did not expect a movie called Cocaine Bear to make me feel anything. The film won't be a timeless classic, but it's a really good time at the movies.And Y'know what? If it's not trying to be anything other than that, I'm perfectly happy with it.\n",
            "Cocaine Bear is very self aware which is exactly what should be expected from a movie with that title but the problem is that it doesn't make it funny. Pretty much none of the jokes landed for me and the movie looked very plain and uninteresting. For a movie set in the 80s I would expect more flair and a better energy from it. I think that problem comes down mainly to the director, Elizabeth Banks. I think she has no sense of comedic timing and her movies look very bland. Additionally, the cast is underwhelming as they weren't the right people to bring the necessary charisma and energy into the movie. A film like Cocaine Bear needs character actors that can liven up the movie whilst chewing the scenery. We get some of that but this movie needed guys like Nicolas Cage or Gary Busey to go make it live up to its title.Furthermore, the character dynamics and their plots are not what I was looking for. Instead of a family story this should have just followed a few groups of cops and gangsters, maybe some junkies looking for the lost cocaine and getting mauled by the bear. Now, it does sort of happen but the movie tried to have too much of a feel-good story with nice characters that just didn't fit. What it needed was that 70s/80s sleaze that some schlock movies from that era used to have where the majority of the characters are corrupt and we just want the bear to murder them all. That's not to say Cocaine Bear is all bad. I did appreciate some of the gore and despite me complaining about the cast, some of them did a good job like Ray Liotta who fit the movie well but wasn't allowed to do much in it. Also it's nice to get an R-rated movie in the cinema instead of the usual watered down family entertainment that gets released constantly. On top of that, it's nice and short although it does drag a bit. However, I just think the movie could've been more if the director and cast were more suited to the project and if the movie went all out but as it stands it's just bearable.\n"
